# Expectation Maximization Algorithm

This repository will illustrate several concepts related to the Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm. For more information about EM algorithm you can also traverse and read my [WIKI](https://github.com/annumaheshwari/The-Expectation_Maximization_Algorithm/wiki) page.
In this wiki page you will find genesis of EM algorithm, phenomenon of the expectation maximization algorithm, few samples examples and codes, some of the links for you tube videos which are explaining the basic idea of the expectation maximization algorithm. I also have uploaded a you tube video which is enlightening the concepts of EM algorithm in a simpler way. If you will face any trouble while understanding the video, you may leave your query as a comment on the video. I will try my best to reply you with the resposes ASAP.You can find the [liks](https://github.com/annumaheshwari/The-Expectation_Maximization_Algorithm/wiki/Tutorial-Videos) here.
